# Project Portfolio
### Thomas Monahan


Hello and welcome to my project portfolio! These projects range from complex Physical models and simulations, electronics embedded system design and testing, to in depth data exploration and analysis of marketing data. 


**[eCommerce Marketing Data Exploration and Analysis](https://github.com/tmonahan01/Portfolio/blob/master/Marketing%20Data%20Exploration%20and%20Analysis.ipynb)**   
•Performed exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Scikit-learn to identify critical factors for in-person sales aswell as evaluate various marketing campaign’s effectiveness.  
•Conducted extensive data cleansing, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding for a large Kaggle data setcontaining 2,240 unique customer profiles.  
•Performed statistical analysis and generated data-driven insights to identify lagging products and increase futurecampaign efficacy.  
  
**[Rowing Biomechanics Training Tool](https://github.com/tmonahan01/Portfolio/blob/master/Electronics%20Final%20Project%20(1).docx)**  
•Designed and built a training tool using an Arduino Uno that quantifies biomechanical factors of the rowing strokeand provides users with real-time actionable metrics.  
•Conducted human user trials to evaluate the efficacy of the training sensor and application.  
•Provided users with a simple UI as well as real-time data sonification that allowed veteran rowers to considerablyimprove technical efficiency.  
•Refined techniques for both hardware and software debugging and troubleshooting.  
**[Rowing Stroke Simulation](https://github.com/tmonahan01/Portfolio/blob/master/Comp%20Phys%20Final%20Project%20Final%20Draft.ipynb)**  
•Implemented a Runge-Kutta based method to generate numerical solutions for a differential model of the rowingstroke.  
•Developed problem solving techniques as well as a systematic process for debugging and troubleshooting.  
•Deepened my understanding of Python’s functionality as a modeling tool and learned techniques to conciselypresent complex findings.
